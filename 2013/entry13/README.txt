Run '01_get_ephemeris_telnet.py' to create the required data sets that will be
stored in a subdirectory named 'ephemeris_helio'.

Run '02_create_plots.py' to create EPS plots in 'figs_eps', and PNG plots in
'figs_png'.  It creates hundreds of plots.

The plot that I am submitting for the competition is
'figs_eps/solar_system_plot_page_021.eps'.  It shows the orbits of Jupiter and
it's moons from a heliocentric frame of reference.  Each color of the orbit
represents 1 week.

Kindest regards,
Tim Cera
