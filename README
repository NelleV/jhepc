This tree contains all of the entries for the 2013 Scipy John Hunter
Excellence in Plotting Contest.

There is an easy-to-navigate set of web pages rooted at
`build/html/index.html`.  This contains thumbnails and captions to all
of the entries and links to other formats and source code.

If you wish to run the source code and reproduce plots, each entry
directory at the toplevel contains source code and data.  In some
cases where the data is too large or proprietary has not been
included.  In some cases, the source code is in a public source code
repository, so it has not been duplicated here.
